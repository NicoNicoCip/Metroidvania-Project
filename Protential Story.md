# BACKGROUND #

The game takes place in 212X. Humanity is has started public space exploration
100 years ago, and people started moving to other planets in hope of saving 
their own: Earth.

Due to global warming, and because a certain megacorp nuked half the planet,
killing off 80% of life on earth in the first 2 years, with the rest taking
refuge on the moon, humanity for a while was almost but extinct. however,
due to the ingenuity of a certain pioneer, they managed to use the resources
of the moon to launch humanity into the space age, albeit not without scarifice.

The bombing of the planet came to be known as The Final First Step (TFFS) to the 
survivors, meaning that the end of the earth, and of most life on the planet
marked the start of another life for humans, in the cosmos. They also use TFFS
to mark where in space they are, marking their coordinates systems as if
TFFS is 0 0 0, counted in light years.

Of course, most of this information might as well stay in this file for what the
actual story of the game is, but it does help rationalize a bit.

# MAIN CHARACTER #

You play as a DSCS Marine. Deep Space Combat Sentinels or DSCS (Pronounced Discs) 
for short is a special military division tasked finding and recording all the
hidden truths of the planets they explore. You, are a foot soldier, one that
got wounded in battle and found himself stuck in an old military that feels
oddly human, especially on a planet that goes super far away from TFFS.

You go down an elevador, find some misterious boots that you try on; its not 
like you have anything to lose. Then, you get jumped by a misterious humanoid
being with no name (for now) that decide that you shouldnt have the boots, and
decides to cut your legs off, since the suit fuzes with your body once worn.

You defeat them, and go on your many way to the next area... that i havent
figured out just yet.

The game ends with yu leaving the planet or something, after you defeat a boss,
idk.

# GAMEPLAY #

The game is spearated into 3 main parts. Shooting, puzzling, and platforming.
most of the time, you will see 2 of the 3 combined together, or just 1 of them
in isolation.

Shooting means killing enemies to get hp and ammunition back in small ammounts
(you can shoot your main as many times as you want.) Platforming means mainly
Dashing, wall jumping, double dashing, and sliding. For shooting you have the
simple blaster, the focus laser; hold to charge, a thin bean shoots out at where
it will land that deals no dammage, and release to shoot out a beam that deals
dammage proportional to the ammount that you hold. Hold for too long, and your
gun won't shoot out anything and overheat for 5 seconds, hold for too little 
and you deal less dammage. But hitting the right spot, deals a but load of 
dammage, the ice beam, a laser that when shot freeses enemies in place making
them a temporary platform mid air for about 10 seconds, and the chain gun that
starts out slow but gets faster with time, allowing to shoot out an absurd
ammount of amunition per second at a dammage slightly lower than the main,
but its ammo is non infinite. As a matter of fact, all 3 of these weapons have
limited ammunition, and limited amunition space (metroid style.) As for pizzles
you got the classic card / key puzzles, platformer puzzles, phisics puzzles,
and speed puzzles. You will never have to do a puzzle that needs you to kill
something to progress. Instead, the killing will be to make you more aware
of your suroundings and to serve as punishment for bad platforming (the enemies
i mean, otherwise there are no steaks,) for but clenching moments, boss fights,
pace breakers, and for road blocks. i think.

The levels will range from claustrophobic to large and vertigo enducing,
to narrow and long, or thing and tall, etc. in general most levels will be 
somewhat flat, with lots of verticalaty to make you jump arround. Along with
that, back tracking is mandatory (metroidvania o-0) but not pointless or
dragging. Going back, you will allways have acces to new routes that make use
of whatever tools you have a the time + whatever you have won from copmpleteing
the route to make it more interesting going back, not necesaraly faster. These
paths will also be harder than the normal paths to provide some sort of
challenge to the player. This does mean that they will also most likely get
some sort of upgrage at the end of them, minor, just something to make it worth
it.

This philosophy of "Do something but not for nothing" will be through the entire
game.
