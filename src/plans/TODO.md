## [ ] SECTION 1 ##
	
	you will start in the warehouse, where you will learn how buttons work.
	
	after that, you will see the key across the gap, and  will try to get to
	it. you won't be able to. so instead you go left.
	
	there, you will be met with another door, but this time the button needs
	a blue key, that you have seen before, across the gap.
	
	before the door, there's a passage that gets you to a platformer challenge.
	
	once you complete it, you get the key, and you can jump the gap to get
	to the start.
	
	after that, press the button with the key in hand, (this will delete the 
	key) and you will get yourself the first part of the suit. the boots.
	
	After this, you will be met with another tutorial on how the boots work.
	
	they allow you to dash. while dashing into a wall at the right angle, you
	will ride up it. 
	
	you can dash mid air after jumping to get more distance, or to jump to 
	previously unreachable areas.
	
	after the little tutrial track, you get back to the front of the storage
	area where you can choose to go back, to where you got the key, and get
	a secret item, that is an upgrade for something later in the game.
	
	finally, going back to the storage room, you will be met with "Deaf"
	(name pending), who is the first boss of this area.
	
	if you choose to ignore him completely, he will stop you, put his hand on
	your sholder, turn you arround and say "Well... You're a fresh face. 
	What are you doing in a place like this? And those boots, are not your's
	to wear either."
	
	if you get close to him, he will turn towards you and say "Well... Didn't 
	see you there. I'm a bit deaf, you see..." He will try to get closer to you.
	
	if you try to walk away at this moment, he will do the same thing as before
	and stop you by putting his hand on your shoulder and saing. "What's the
	rush! Stay with me just a bit longer, friend..."
	
	if you dont, he will ash you the main question, that he will ask in all 3
	of the situations: run away instantly, run away later, or dont run. choosing
	to do either one of these, will result in the same end.
	
	he will ask "Say. You don't happen to know of a guy named... Thomas White,
	do you?" at this point you can nod yes or no.
	
	if you respond with yes, he will say "You do? You wouldn't lie to a friend,
	would you? Because if you knew him, he would NEVER, in a million years let
	you wear those."
	
	if you respong with no, he will say "Right, right. of course you don't. 
	You must be some scare child that found their way in this wretched place."
	
	regardles of what you choose he will say the next part after the part before.
	he will start moving back, and his suit will start glowing.
	"You are in possesion of something that you really shouldn't have. And
	sadly, those things fuze with yout body when you put them on, so ill have to
	... cut you... from them." he will start to float, he will swipe his hands
	and send you flying. the room will open up, with the rafters collapsing,
	one of them closing your escape. "Nothing personal, friend. But you just
	HAD to poke your nose in the wrong place."
	
	a boss fight will start, where you have to scale the rafters closes to him
	and dash into him. this is signaled by a box jammed in the roof falling
	on him dealing visible damage. after dashing into him 3 times, he will
	lose balance and fall to the ground, where he will scrape the floor and 
	break the rafter blocking the entrance. he will break some boxes in the room
	and leave behind his arm, along with that part of his suit, before walking
	over to the right path, and dashing across it off screen.
