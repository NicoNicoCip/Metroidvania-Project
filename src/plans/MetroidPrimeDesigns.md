1. The levels are super detailed, and long. Each area has hundreds of sections the size Room1.

2. You will allways find emenies in your path that you will have to shoot. Allmost all of them have some sort of unique mechanic that makes them... unique. Even variants.

3. You will have "access" to areas later on in the game from earlyer on. You can try to go through them, but you will either hit a roadblock or die trying.

4. You will allso be able to see items, upgrades and special things in the world, that you will eventually be able to get to. Note that when you do, you get that AHA! moment, and think "So that's how i get there... or... here."

5. The upgrades are super separate, and starting out you can do allmost nothing, other than shoot jump and slide arround. But then you get the misile and now you can shoot misile doors,you get the morph ball, then the morph ball bomb, then the Varia suit (hot areas suit), and throughout it all, energy tanks, and more rockets, and so on.
